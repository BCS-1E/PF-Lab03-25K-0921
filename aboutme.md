# About Me

My name is Rubas Mustafa, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at FAST.  

Beyond academics, I have a strong interest in web and app development, and I have been learning through various courses in these areas. I am also working on an ERP software project using **Odoo**.  

Apart from my degree-related interests, two of my essential hobbies are **photography** and **researching**.
