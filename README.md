My name is Rubas Mustafa, and I am currently a first-year student at FAST, pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

Alongside my academics, I have been exploring web and app development since my matriculation through various courses. At present, I am working on an ERP software project using Odoo and developing my own application called Al-Fath.

**You can check out updates about Al-Fath on Instagram:** _@alfath.app_
